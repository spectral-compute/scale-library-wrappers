 *
 * The reason why a signal allocated by hsa_amd_signal_create cannot satisfy (2) is because the HIP API returns a
 * pointer to the signal value (from hsa_amd_signal_value_pointer) rather than the signal itself, and finds the signal
 * itself by looking it up in a map it stores internally. There's no API to go in the other direction to
 * hsa_amd_signal_value_pointer (i.e: from value pointer to signal rather than from signal to value pointer).
 *
 * The HSA signal type is actually an `amd_signal_t`. The value returned by the HIP allocator is a pointer to a field
 * within that struct. This function does a reverse struct element address calculation.
